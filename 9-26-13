Map!
Prices are expensive, which leads us to:
- focus on the Midden property, Steve/Lorna, and Patrick's properties
- expand geographically, esp. east of 71/Cleveland

What about the empty lots left in Weinland Park?
- Tiny houses, straw bale, park a bus? Look into legality.
- If there's no laws, we won't be able to get a building permit

1023!
Cole and Alex filled out almost all of the form that is self-evident
Cole will digitize it and send it out
A couple things came out of it:
- There's only a short awesome list that will be fun to work on: narrative of our activities, resale formula.
- Some questions are still not self-evident after lots of research, so we'd like to get the actual 1023 form from another land trust. Yellow Springs (Alex will call)? Cleveland?
- A little complications because the Midden is a LLC
- Since we're in Ohio, we don't need a dissolution clause; it defaults to Ohio's default dissolution law.

Stuff to do together:
- Articles of incorporation (Part II) and bylaws
- Narrative of activities 
- Resale and renting formula
- VI: how do we limit the services
- Schedule F: providing low-income housing
- Predicting financial data
- Bad news: $750 (FEC might fund it?)

Decided! Copy/paste Purpose from model bylaws
