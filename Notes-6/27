1023 form and FAQ's

What does 501c3 status actually "get" us?
- exempt from corporate income tax
- exempt from property taxes
- don't pay taxes on lots of other things too
- donations to the CLT are tax-exempt for the donor
- eligable for public and private grants

better understanding of what's involved
- There's 2 types of 501(c)3's: public charity (us), and private foundations (rich, privately funded)
- There's more detail about our financial exchanges than our activities. Our activities need a standard who/what/when/where/why/how/funded narrative, plus evidence. 
- 6 month approval, 1 month turnaround if they tell us something is incorrect
- Will need to file 990's with strict accounting every year
- There's a mandatory conflict of interest policy (answers some of our questions about outside interests)
- We'll need an EIN (Alex will get this)

Different relationships to the CLT:
Homeowners/lessees: These folks still own their home, but have given or sold their land to the CLT. Thus, they are leasing the land from the CLT. They still have the right to rent out a room to someone, but cannot function as a "landlord" and live off-premise.
Renters: In this case, the CLT owns both the land and the structural property. The CLT serves the role that a landlord or property manager would in other contexts.
Potentially: a third party entity such as a cooperative business could occupy a different sort of relationship, but we're not there yet.
