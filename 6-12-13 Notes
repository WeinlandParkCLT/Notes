6/12/13 (I think!) on Midden's deck

- Report Backs
  - Steve's "do less evil" fairy tale email! We discussed our reactions: 
    - who takes care of houses in the meantime? 
    - We need to imagine the numbers. 
    - Our goal, we agree, is to have properties paid off and free. Could Rebuilding Together Central Ohio be a partner? 
    - What are our thoughts about big-name players doing CLT's. We may have concluded that we are not prioritizing the increase of home ownership.
    - CLT's as ecosystems, food for thought
  - Alex created a supporters list. Do we want to send email updates? Alex is down for it, and so is Steve (though he'd rather not write it)
  - Mapping: in a ditch?
  - Alex is meeting with Tammy and Kaybea Jones this Friday. Dave doesn't like Tammy too much.
  - Alex attended the WP Dialogue sessions follow up meeting. We are doing fucking great, comparatively. Other groups want to know how to be an effective group (community organizing 101)
    - Suggestion: those people interested in effectiveness should get added to our supporters list?
- Bylaws
  - Put off till next meeting
- Why the fuck do we want a CLT?
  - Steve: access to a place to live, don't be slaves to this economy, meet basic needs, ensuring long-term affordability
  - Lorna: ownership without the long-term baggage of owning a home, meeting new residents where they're at, 
  - Alex: perpetuity: maintaining diversity over the long term, instead of getting stuck in what you start; make a more diverse/complex community. a perma-community. something that is easy to vocalize; to be a gem of grassroots organizing.
  - Cole and Eric: I'm a bad note-taker and started talking instead of writing at this point. 
  
  Next meeting: tonight! 6/19 at 6:30pm/
